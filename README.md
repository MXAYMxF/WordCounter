# WordCounter
Count words from a text file and save it as a csv

This small tool opens a text file, counts each word and how many times it appears. 

The tool then saves the result as a comma delimetted file within the same directory (CSV)

libraries used were pandas and tnkeeh (I did not benefit from the latter as I was able to find an alternative for researched input)
